# Henley Passport Index Data - Tidy Tuesday - 09.09.2025
This week we are exploring data from the Henley Passport Index API. The Henley Passport Index is produced by Henley & Partners and captures the number of countries to which travelers in possession of each passport in the world may enter visa free.

For each travel destination, if no visa is required for passport holders from a country or territory, then a score with value = 1 is created for that passport. A score with value = 1 is also applied if passport holders can obtain a visa on arrival, a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination. These visa-types require no pre-departure government approval, because of the specific visa-waiver programs in place. Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value = 0 is assigned. A score with value = 0 is also assigned if passport holders need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival, a scenario we do not consider ‘visa-free’. The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required (value = 1), under the conditions defined above.

Henley & Partners update the Global Passport Index rankings each month and changes to the US passport rank captured media attention recently.

Thank you to [Brenden Smith and Jen Richmond](https://github.com/brendensm @jenrichmond) for curating this week's dataset.

## Dataset
* **Source:** [Tidy Tuesday - 09.09.2025](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-09-09/)

## Tech Stack
* `pandas`
* `np`
* `power bi`

## Tidy Tuesday questions
- Which countries have made the most dramatic improvements in passport power? Which passports have lost the most visa-free access?
- Do countries with stronger trade relationships tend to offer mutual visa-free access?
- Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect passport rankings, particularly for countries that implemented strict border controls?
- How does political instability or economic crisis impact passport strength?

## Key Steps
1. **Step 1. Exploring Dataset**
2. **Step 2. Cleaning Data**
3. **Step 3. Exporting data for Power BI Dashboard**
4. **Step 4. Power BI Dashboard Creation**

## Project Objective
To keep practicing data analytics, dashboard creation pandas and power bi. I will attempt to answer questions stated in this challenge with all the tools available to me.
